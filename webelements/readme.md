## Description

This repo is for the webElements Custom Function library for Crystal Reports on SAP BI / BusinessObjects Enterprise / Crystal Reports Server 4.3. This library allows a report writer to add web controls to a report file to create custom prompt / parameter dialogues. As these are Crystal Reports Custom Functions, they are open source and free.
